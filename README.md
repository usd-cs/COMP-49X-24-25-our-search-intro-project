# COMP 491 Intro Project by the OUR SEARCH Team
## About
This introductory project is a basic web forum where users can create posts and comments on posts. This project involves three functional requirements, such as allowing all users to view text-based posts, authenticated users to create posts and comments, and admins to delete posts and comments. It features a graphical interface and software frameworks that the OUR SEARCH team plans to use for their upcoming SEARCH project: client/server with React.js and Java Spring with a relational database. The project serves as a tool for its developers to gain experience with Agile processes and their chosen software framework.
